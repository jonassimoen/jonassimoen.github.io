# Pre-matchday analysis

### Goalkeepers
Starting of with the highest rated players, we find a lot of goalkeepers. Since Standard receives the newly promoted RAAL, the chances for a clean sheet are high. Combined with a 4M goalkeeper on the bench, Coosemans or Epolo are a good pick.

### Defenders
Looking at last season, Mechele scored 218 points, the highest among all defenders. Pick the 8M player, you should consider saving on midfielders and or forwards (or maybe other defenders).

For defenders, 2 type of players are interesting: the players who are likely to keep a clean sheet and the ones who are likely to score or give an assist.

For the first category, Mechelen players (facing newly promoted Zulte Waregem) are a good pick. Welsh or Raemaekers (59 pts and 133 pts last season) are the highest predicted. Zekri is a 16-year-old defender and has just signed a contract with Malinois, despite some big European clubs being interested. Other teams having a high chance to keep a clean sheet are Standard (vs RAAL), RSCA, Brugge/Genk or Cercle/Dender (this could be a closed game). And thus other interesting players are Hautekiet (Standard, 168 pts last season), Fossey (Standard, 191 pts), Ordonez (Brugge, 137 pts last season).

For the second category, Mechele (Club Brugge) is a good pick for the whole season (3G last season). Other possibilities are Jordan Bos (Westerlo, 4G, pts), Daam Foulon (Antwerp, 3G/4A, 105 pts last season with KVM), El Ouadi (Genk, 3G, 161 pts), Pupe (Dender, 5A, 118 pts, currently injured), Ferraro (Dender, 5A, 147 pts, 5M), Patris (STVV, 5A, 96 pts), Reynolds (Westerlo, 4A, 124 pts, 6.5M).

More budget-friendly picks can be Hrncar (Dender, 6M, 160 pts), Petris (Charleroi, 6M, 160 pts) or Simic (RSCA, 6M, 159 pts), Cools (Dender, 6M, 160 pts)

### Midfielders
Vanaken combined with Tzolis was an absolute winner pick: scoring 235 and 223 points respectively. Vanaken is very consistent last season (865 points: 204-238-188-235). Heymans (Charleroi, 9M, 193 pts), Zorgane (USG, 9.5M, 184 pts), Schoofs (KVM, 9.5M, 181 pts), Steuckers (Genk, 9.5M, 174 pts), Vanhoutte (USG, 8.5M, 167 pts).

For a more budget-friendly pick, I would opt for Rodes (Dender, 6.5M, 163 pts). Heymans recently transferred from Charleroi to Genk, price has increased to 9M, and was last season a point getter with 193 points.

### Forwards
The highest predicted are Eckert (Standard, 8M, 136 pts) and Bertaccini (STVV, 10M, 166 pts), Dolberg (RSCA, 10.5M, 167 pts) are good picks looking at last year. Stulic (CHA, 9M, 153 pts) to my opinion, will get it more difficult than last year. Charleroi didn't seem very attractive looking at yesterday's European game. Dolberg has been subbed off after 60min in the Europa League game, having a small injury. Another less ideal pick for GW 1, maybe later it is good to transfer him in!
Eckert (facing RAAL) and Bertaccini (facing 'damaged' Gent) are the best picks I presume, looking at the opponent and predictions. Other options (for the long term) can be Vermant (Brugge, 8M, 103 pts in total, 53 in the play-offs), Vossen (returning to the 1st division with Zulte), Raman (KVM, 7.5M, 129 pts in 32 games).

Ivanovic/Promise David are also good picks of the champion (USG, 172/168 pts, 10/10.5M). But Ivanovic is probably leaving for Benfica. Other possible goal getters are Tolu (Genk, 11M, 186 pts).

More budget-friendly options: Frigan (Westerlo, 9M, 148 pts) or Berete (Dender, 7M, 101 pts).

## Final team
Considering and combining the 3 used models, excluding player which are not active in JPL anymore & injuries/inavailabilites.
